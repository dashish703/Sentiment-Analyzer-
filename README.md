# Sentiment Analyzer

This is a Python-based Sentiment Analyzer that uses the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for sEntiment Reasoning) sentiment analysis tool from the `nltk` (Natural Language Toolkit) library to classify text into **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral** sentiments.

## Features
- Analyzes input text and determines sentiment based on the VADER model.
- Returns sentiment scores including positive, negative, neutral, and compound values.
- Provides an easy-to-use interface for sentiment classification.

## Requirements

Before running the script, ensure that you have the following libraries installed:

- `nltk` (Natural Language Toolkit)

You can install `nltk` using pip:

```bash
pip install nltk

How It Works
The script uses the SentimentIntensityAnalyzer from the VADER model to analyze the sentiment of a given text. The sentiment is determined based on the compound score:
Compound score >= 0.05: Positive Sentiment
Compound score <= -0.05: Negative Sentiment
Else: Neutral Sentiment

Example Output
For the input text:
I'm Feeling Good Today!
The analyzer produces the following result:

text
Copy code
Sentiment: Positive
Sentiment Scores: {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.299, 'pos': 0.701, 'compound': 0.5707}

How to Run
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the directory where the Analyzer!.py file is located.
Run the script:
python Analyzer!.py

When prompted, enter the text you want to analyze for sentiment.
Sample Usage
Enter text for sentiment analysis: I'm Feeling Good Today!

Output:
Sentiment: Positive
Sentiment Scores: {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.299, 'pos': 0.701, 'compound': 0.5707}
